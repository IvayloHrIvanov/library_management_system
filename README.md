# Library Management System

A console-based Library Management System designed to perform essential library operations such as adding books, borrowing books, returning books, and listing available books. This project was developed to meet personal goals and to practice software development skills.

Core-features of the task:

- Add Books: Add new books to the library's collection.

- Remove Books: Remove books from the library's collection.
  
- Borrow Books: Allow users to borrow books from the library.
  
- Return Books: Enable users to return borrowed books.
  
- List Available Books: Display all books currently available in the library.

- Search Books: Search a book by name.

Future Enhancements:

- Implement persistence by saving the library's current state (books and users) to a text file and loading it back when the program starts.
  
- Due Date Tracking: Add functionality to set due dates for borrowed books, and include reminders for overdue books.
  
- Add a genre/category filter and enable searching by this attribute.
  
- Other
